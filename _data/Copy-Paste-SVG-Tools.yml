  Scripts for moving SVG shape data to and from Figma (or other apps)
  via pasteboard. These enable you to: 1) Have a new menu item (Edit > Copy Glyph
  as SVG), which should take the current glyph and put it in your pasteboard as SVG
  data 2) Allow most Figma-based "copy-as-svg"s to be able to be pasted directly into
  RF.
