name: Add Angled Guideline on Selection

description: |
  If you select two points and hit Shift+Control+G, it will make an angled
  guideline on the two points. If the selection has 1 pt, it will make a horizontal
  guide. I forget what happens when you have more than 2 selected points, but it's
  less useful.
