  This tool speeds up the process of syncing point length ratios across
  multiple sources. Select points in one open source, and corresponding glyphs in
  other open sources will automatically adjust (make sure those glyph windows are
  open, or changes will occur unseen). The tool offers options to either match the
  ratio of the selected points in the current glyph or make all corresponding points
  adhere to the calculated average ratio between them. You can also specify how much
  it adjusts on-curve versus off-curve points. Also, it has a basic global undo button.
  It works best with Smooth Operator and AngleRatioTool. Use those to diagnose issues
  and this tool to fix them. Open to name suggestions for this tool :)
