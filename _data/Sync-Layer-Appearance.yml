  RoboFont layer's drawing states are sometimes a bit fiddly to edit. 
  Different colors, different fills. When your designspace has many sources 
  switching between different states can be visually jarring. This here 
  script takes the current font as a model, and then applies its layer 
  states and layer colors to the other open sources.
